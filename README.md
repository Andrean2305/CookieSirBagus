# CookieSirBagus

Hello Sir Bagus, this is our cookie that we use for our FP

So, we make a social media for musician. 

In this cookie code, it basically will store what we search. So for example i search baba, and if i reload baba will still be in the search bar 

Set_Cookie function in the api is used to set the api to local 8k (this is not really useful, however i just add the code in case you want us to use API)

In the postlist we make a local storage(not really local storage [it is a cookie but just think cookie as the local stoorage]), that is setting the cookies every we type in the search bar, and will take that local storage cookie value everytime we reload the page
